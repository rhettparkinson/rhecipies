- To a pot add the entire can of fava beans including the liquid. Add the ground cumin and paprika and simmer over a low heat until most but not all of the liquid is gone.
- Meanwhile, grab a mortar and pestle and add the garlic, chilli, and salt, and pound it into a rough paste. Add about half the lemon juice and pound it into a smoother paste.
- Prepare your chosen toppings; sumac, parsley and tomatoes are pretty essential, but you can experiment. I've also use capsicum, radishes, coriander, feta cheese, etc.
- Now that the fava beans have softened, reserve a tablespoon of whole beans to put on the top at the end. Mash the cooked beans in the pot with the pestle (or whatever you have) to a smooth or chunky consistency, whichever you prefer.
- Add the tahini and give a good stir, then add the rest of the lemon juice.
- Get a shallow bowl or plate and smooth out the mashed beans, and top with the whole beans you reserved earlier, as well as your other toppings.
- Drizzle generously with olive oil. Sprinkle with sumac and it's ready to eat.
