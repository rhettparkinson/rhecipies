excerpt: Tangy and crunchy, it's awesome in sandwiches, tacos, salads, or as a side.

{% ingredient %}
- 1/4 red cabbage
- 1 or 2 cloves garlic, sliced
- 1 bay leaf
- ground pepper
- 1/2 cup vinegar (experiment with different kinds)
- 1 cup water
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
{% endingredient %}

{% method %}
- Slice the cabbage into very thin strips. I find the best way is to cut away the core, pull apart the leaves, then stack a few at a time and slice.
- Add the sliced cabbage, garlic, bay leaf and ground pepper to a jar.
- Add the remaining ingredient to a pot and heat gently, stiring until dissolved. Pour over the cabbage. If the liquid doesn't quite cover the cabbage that's okay, some more liquid will come out of the cabbage.
- Don't put it in the fridge yet, let it sit out for at least a few hours. Give it a good stir and store in the fridge. It's good for a few weeks and can be eaten pretty much straight away, but will be better after at least 24 hours.
