{% endingredient %}

{% method %}
- Preheat oven to 220°C.
- Blanch silverbeet stalks in a large saucepan of salted water until just tender (5 minutes). Drain and refresh in iced water, then drain well and transfer to a 2.5 litre ovenproof dish.
- Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat, add shallots and stir occasionally until soft and translucent (5 minutes). Increase heat to medium, add flour and cook, stirring, until sandy coloured (2 minutes). Gradually add milk and stock, stirring continuously until smooth and incorporated. Stir in cheddar, mustard and nutmeg, season to taste, then pour sauce over silverbeet stalks.
- Combine breadcrumbs with oil and sprinkle on top, grate a little parmesan on top then bake until golden and bubbly (20-25 minutes). Serve hot.
