{% method %}
- Rinse the lentils well and add to a medium pot with the water, cooking over a medium-low heat until the lentils are mushy.
- While there is still plenty of liquid, add the salt, Vegeta, spice-blend, tumeric, asofetida, tomatoes, and fresh ginger.
- Simmer for another 10 minutes or until the lentils have the desired consistency; I like mine kind of soupy. Add a big squeeze of lemon juice to the pot.
- Now take care with this step as it's easy to burn this ish. In a very small pan/pot heat the oil. Now in this order add: the cumin seeds, dried chillies, spring onion, garlic, and (if using) curry leaves.
- Pour the oil mixture over the top of the lentils. Garnish with a little bit of chopped coriander.
