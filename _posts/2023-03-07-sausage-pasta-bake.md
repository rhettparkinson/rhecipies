- Preheat the oven to 200ºC.
- Tear the stale bread into chunks and blitz in the food processor.
- Tip the breadcrumbs into a bowl with one of the sliced garlic cloves, a good pinch of the oregano, the grated cheese and a pinch of sea salt and a sprinkling of black pepper. Drizzle with a little oil and toss to mix it all together.
- Break the sausages into small chunks. If they try to fall apart just roll them into balls. Drizzle over a little oil and roll to coat them, then bake in the oven for about 10 minutes, or until golden and cooked through.
- Meanwhile, heat some oil in a pan and add the remaining sliced garlic and oregano, chilli flakes. Saute until the garlic is coloured.
- Add the tomatoes to the pan, a pinch of salt and pepper, and simmer for 10 minutes stirring occasionally.
- Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions, taking it off the heat 2 minutes early, so it’s al dente. Drain then tip into a large baking dish.
- Add the sausage pieces, pour over the sauce, and toss well. Sprinkle over the cheesy crumb mix.
- Bake for 20 minutes until golden on top and bubbling.
