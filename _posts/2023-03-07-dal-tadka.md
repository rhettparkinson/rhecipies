{% method %}

- Rinse the lentils well and add to a medium pot with the water, cooking over a medium-low heat until the lentils are mushy.
- While there is still plenty of liquid, add the salt, Vegeta, garam masala or spice-blend of choice, tumeric, asofetida, tomatoes, and fresh ginger.
- Simmer for another 10 minutes or until the lentils have the desired consistency (I like mine kind of soupy). Add a big squeeze of lemon juice to the pot.
- In a very small pan/pot heat the ghee. Now in this order add: the cumin seeds, dried chillies, garlic, spring onion, and curry leaves.
- Pour the oil mixture over the top of the lentils. Garnish with chopped coriander. Serve with steamed rice and Indian bread of choice.
