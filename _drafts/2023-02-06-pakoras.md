excerpt: Spiced, battered, deep-fried vegetable fritters. You can use any vegetables you like but I like broccoli and cauliflower the best.
notes: Cook pakoras slowly to ensure the vegetables cook through, no need to pre-cook them.

{% method %}
- Combine the flour, salt, spices and chilli in a bowl and mix to combine.
- Slowly add the water, mixing with a fork or whisk until it gets a creamy texture.
- Let the batter site for at least 10 minutes. When you dip the vegetables they should be completely coated, so adjust the batter if necessary.
- Heat enough oil for deep-frying, dip some vegetables in the batter and add them to the oil, frying them in batches.
- Fry until golden brown, turning them as necessary. Remove and drain on some paper towel. 
- Eat them warm with with your sauce or chutney of choice. Also good cold without any condiments lol.
