{% ingredient %}
- 3 cups of vegetable stock
- 1 cup dry brown lentils
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 2 tbsp butter
- 3 cloves garlic minced

- 1/2 can kidney beans, rinsed (optional)
- 2/3 can of coconut milk

{% method %}
- Check the lentils for any stones and wash. Using heavy pot or dutch oven, add them with 3 cups of stock and the bay leaf, put the lid on and let them cook on medium-high until they are nice and mushy.
- If you have a mortar, add the chopped garlic and ginger with half a  teaspoon of salt and pound into a paste.
- Add the tomato puree, most of the fresh coriander, all of the spices, the ginger and garlic, plus 1 tbsp of brown sugar or honey to the pot. Add some more water if the liquid is getting low. Reduce heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes.
- If including the kidney beans, add them now and simmer for another 5-10 minutes.
- Adjust seasoning.
- Add about 1/2 a can of coconut milk. You may have to use your own judgement here because the amount of coconut milk you will add here will primarily depend on how dried out the lentils were when they were cooked.
- Add to serving bowls and garnish with some of the leftover chopped coriander, and a drizzle of coconut milk.
- Serve with roti, and some lemon wedges — the tartness of the lemons will bring out all the warmth and sweetness from the dal.
