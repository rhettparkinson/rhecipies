{% method %}
- In a large saucepan, bring the stock to a boil. Add potatoes, carrots, parsnip, and celery. Return to the boil, reduce heat, and simmer until vegetables are tender.
- Add pickles and any accumulated juices, and combine well.
- Temper the sour cream in a small heatproof bowl by adding a few ladles of hot soup and whisking constantly.
- Transfer the tempered sour cream back to the soup, and heat through until starting to simmer but do not boil or the sour cream will break.
- Serve hot in heated bowls with chopped fresh herbs and slices of some rustic bread.
