- Heat deep pan over medium high heat. Add the oil, garlic, and ginger, sautéing until light brown and crispy and the oil smells fragrant.
- Add shiitake and season with salt and pepper, and cook for about 2 minutes.
- Stir in hot pepper flakes and sauté for about 30 seconds.
- Add the onion, green chili pepper, and green onion. Stir for 1 minute until the vegetables turn slightly withered.
- Stir in soy sauce and hot pepper paste.
- Add 1 cup of stock and cook for about 2 minutes until vigorously boiling.
- Add the tofu cubes and gently mix being careful not to break up the tofu. Cook for about 3 to 4 minutes until the tofu turns soft.
- While the tofu is cooking, combine the remaining ¼ cup of stock and the cornflour in a small bowl and mix it well. Add it to the boiling mapo tofu and gently stir it in to thicken the sauce.
- Remove from the heat and stir in the sesame oil.
- Serve in large shallow bowls with steamed sushi rice and banchan.
