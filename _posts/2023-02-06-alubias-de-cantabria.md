- Add the vegetables to a pot and fill with enough water to easily cover them. Simmer over a high heat for 20 minutes.
- Once softened, drain the vegetables reserving the broth in a bowl, and allow the cooked vegetables to cool a little.
- Add the veggies to a tall container along with 1 tbsp of the kidney beans and 2 tbsp of the hot broth, season with salt. Using a stick blender, puree until smooth.
