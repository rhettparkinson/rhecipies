{% ingredient %}
- 1 big can of cooked fava beans (450g)
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 2 cloves garlic

- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 cup lemon juice
- 1 tbsp tahini
- olive oil
- optional toppings: sumac, chopped parsley, diced tomatoes, red onion
{% endingredient %}

{% method %}
- Grab a small pot and dump the entire can of fava beans in, including the liquid.
- Add the ground cumin and paprika and simmer over a low heat until most (but not all) of the liquid is gone.
- While that's simmering, grab a mortar and pestle, throw in the garlic gloves and chilli with the salt, and pound it into a rough paste. Add about half the lemon juice and pound it into a slightly smoother paste.
- Prepare your chosen toppings; sumac, parsley and tomatoes are pretty essential imo, but you can experiment. I've also use capsicum, radishes, coriander, feta cheese, etc.
- The fava beans will now be adequetly softened, just scoop out a tablespoon of beans to put on the top at the end.
- Mash the cooked beans in the pot with the pestle (or whatever you have) to your liking, smooth or chunky, it's all good.
- Add the tahini and give a good stir, then add the rest of the lemon juice too.
- Get a shallow bowl or plate and smooth out your mashed beans, and top with the whole beans you reserve as well as your other toppings.
- Drizzle generously with olive oil. Sprink with sumac (if you have that), and it's ready to eat.
- Makes enough to feed one hungry person. Good for breakfast, lunch or dinner.
